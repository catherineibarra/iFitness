## Development Environment

* WinSCP and Cyberduck – our website is tested and run both WinSCP (Windows) and Cyberduck (Mac). We may now open the web page in the browser after uploading the website’s source code to WinSCP/Cyberduck.
* Visual Studio Code – is an incredibly convenient compiler that really aids out development.
* GitHub – we utilize GitHub to manager version control with the team. Each member’s new code will be submitted toGitHub, and other team members will have access to the current version via the GitHub desktop. Additionally,the team may view the modifications madeto the version by each member.
